reorganized code (cleaned up HTML, put all styling done to HTML in css),

fixed HTML elements from doing the smooth transition on page load (important as new visitors would experience this, but if you have cookies saved from the website it wont)

fixed transition times for each object to better represent a smooth spacing,   **I have now removed the transitioning as it feels forced and doesnt really fit well with the design I have in mind.**

fixed the image elements so clearspace does not link to forums. Now the actual icons will link when clicked instead of the blank space around them.

fixed resolution on all image elements on the page for easier height/weight/margin placement

added horizontal rule to top michiana infosec icon (border)

fixed broken images on some users visitation to the site.
